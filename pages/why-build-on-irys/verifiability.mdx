# Verifiability

In the world of blockchain and decentralization, verifiability is essential, ensuring data correctness and trustworthiness. For Irys, this principle is a core feature, making data verification fast, efficient, and accessible.

## Why Verifiability Matters

Verifiability ensures that data on the blockchain is correct and trustworthy. However, traditional datachains often face a trade-off: increased verifiability leading to slower data access because the verification process tends to be computationally intensive.

## How Irys Will Solve the ‘Verifiability Challenge’

- **Optimized Data Preparation**: Irys uses a method called [2D Packing](/mining-on-irys/2d-packing), which prepares storage efficiently and allows the protocol to avoid expensive sealing processes. Miners who (provably) provide storage resources properly benefit from greater rewards, while those who don’t face penalties.

- **Easy Access for Everyone**: Thanks to [2D Packing](/mining-on-irys/2d-packing), verifying data on Irys is simple and does not require specialized hardware. Even standard devices like browsers and mobile phones can handle the verification process. This inclusivity allows anyone to participate in verifying data, making the system more democratic and accessible.

- **Enabling Programmable Data**: Fast data verification is crucial for smart contracts on Irys. Smart contracts need to access data quickly and reliably to function properly. They also need to prove the data is correct. With efficient verification, smart contracts can run smoothly, ensuring security and speed without compromising performance.

For smart contracts to access onchain data during execution, all network participants must agree on the results of computation. Rapidly detecting invalid computations by adversarial miners is essential for maintaining network integrity. Fast and efficient data verification ensures smart contract execution remains swift without compromising security.

Irys optimizes data preparation with 2D Packing, ensuring consistency and efficiency. This incentivizes miners to store data and prevents system abuse while maintaining network integrity by penalizing miners who try to mine unpacked data.
