Irys is the first L1 programmable datachain, designed to optimize data storage and execution. By combining storage and execution, it significantly increases the usefulness of blockspace, enabling a wider range of web services to come onchain that aren’t possible right now.

Irys empowers developers to create and innovate like never before. With Irys, builders can eliminate dependencies, integrate efficient onchain data, and unlock new possibilities for dynamic, real-time applications—all within a unified platform.
