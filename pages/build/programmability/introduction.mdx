# Our alpha testnet is live!

With our testnet live you can store data directly on the L1, build apps with IrysVM and Programmable Data

## IrysVM

As a fork of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the Irys Virtual Machine (IrysVM) leverages the unique capabilities of the Irys blockchain by integrating access to its advanced storage layer, unlocking the potential for Programmable Data.

## Programmable Data

Programmable Irys unlocks a new paradigm where data can be actively used and manipulated in real-time by smart contracts. With Programmable Data, Irys integrates cost-effective data storage and smart-contract functionality, enabling dApps and services to interact programmatically with large amounts of onchain data within a single protocol and ecosystem. This streamlines development, lowers costs, and unlocks unprecedented composability, overcoming the limitations of fragmented integrations.


{/* ## Ledgers
Ledgers are a key data model innovation, allowing for scalable configurable duration storage.
the Irys testnet currently has 2 ledgers:
0: the Perm ledger - This is for data that is stored permanently.
1: the Term ledger - This is for data upload validation for Perm txs. It has a minimum storage duration of `5 days`.
