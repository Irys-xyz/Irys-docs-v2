# Quickstart

This covers how to make use of Irys's `@irys/js` package, but you can also use all EVM compatible tooling for developing apps on Irys.

## Install

```shell
yarn install @irys/js
```

## Grab some tokens!
The testnet faucet can be found [here](https://irys.xyz/faucet)

## Create the client

```js
const irysClient = await new IrysClient("https://testnet-rpc.irys.xyz/v1")
```
## Get your Irys address

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Irys uses the same private keys as Ethereum
</Callout>

```ts
const { irys: irysAddress } = irysClient.account.getAddresses("private key") 
```
For more information about addresses, see [Addresses](/build/programmability/js/addresses)

## Check your balance

```ts
const balancemIrys = await irysClient.account.getBalance("address") // you can use either your Irys or execution address!
```
This gets your balance in `mIrys` (mini-irys), which you can think of as our version of `wei`


## Create and post a data transaction

```ts
// Create a transaction
const tx = irysClient.createTransaction({...}) // the args are optional

// Generates merkle tree for the data
await tx.prepareChunks(<data>);

// Check the price (in mIrys) for uploading your transaction.
// Irys transactions have two fees, a term and a perm fee. 
// perm is only for if you want to store your data permanently (i.e ledger 0)
// Testnet currently only supports `perm` transactions.

const { termFee, permFee } = await tx.getFees();

// get the combined fee
const fee = await tx.getFee();

// Sign the transaction with your private key
const signedTx = await tx.sign(<key>);

// Upload the transaction header
await signedTx.uploadHeader();

// Upload the data
await signedTx.uploadChunks(<data>);
```
