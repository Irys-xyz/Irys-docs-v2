#### Create a programmable data smart contract


Programmable data is a feature leveraged through Solidity smart contracts via a custom precompile.\
We have a library contract to provide a cleaner API to use programmable data [here](https://github.com/Irys-xyz/precompile-libraries/),\
A full example Foundry project [here](https://github.com/Irys-xyz/irys/blob/master/fixtures/contracts/src/IrysProgrammableDataBasic.sol),\
And an example E2E test using `@irys/js` [here](https://github.com/Irys-xyz/irys-js/blob/master/tests/programmableData.ts).


To use this library, first create a Solidity contract that inherits `ProgrammableData`:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

// you will need to set up path remapping and clone the repository as a submodule,
// or copy the library files locally

import "@irys/precompile-libraries/libraries/ProgrammableData.sol";

contract ProgrammableDataBasic is ProgrammableData {
    bytes public storedData;

    function readPdBytesIntoStorage() public {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = readBytes();
        require(success, "reading bytes failed");
        // write bytes to storage
        storedData = data;
    }

    function getStorage() public view returns (bytes memory) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

You then need to deploy your smart contract as normal.

To create a programmable data transaction (which will allow use of the ProgrammableData precompile), follow the following steps:

#### Create a set of Programmable Data read ranges

```ts
const accessList = await irysClient.programmable_data
    .read(transactionId, startOffset, length)
    .toAccessList();
```
This range will read bytes `startOffset` -> `startOffset + length` of `transactionId`'s data.

	Only transactions uploaded to the permanent ledger (ledgerId 0) can be read using programmable data.\
    DataItems uploaded through Irys' bundlers are currently not supported (but will be!)
</Callout>


#### Add them to a execution Transaction
This should be a transaction aiming to call the `readPdBytesIntoStorage` method of the contract. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	You will be charged for every chunk you request, even if you don't read them.\
    So only attach a programmable data access list to a transaction that will use them!
</Callout>

```ts
    import { Wallet } from "ethers";
    const wallet = new Wallet(<key>, irysClient.api.rpcProvider)
    const evmTransaction = {
        accessList: [accessList],
        type: 2 // type must be EIP-1559 or higher
        ....
    }
    await wallet.sendTransaction(evmTransaction);

```
Once the transaction processes, you can call the `getStorage` contract method, which should return the data you specified in your programmable data read range.\
Note that you will pay normal rates for storing data in smart contract storage slots.
