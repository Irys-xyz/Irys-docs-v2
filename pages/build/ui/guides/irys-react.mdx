# Using Irys With npx create-react-app

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	If you're using React with Vite, polyfills are handled differently. You'll need to follow [this guide
	instead](./vite).
</Callout>

Irys is fully compatible with React, however, if you’re using `npx create-react-app` to create your project, you will need to do some additional configuration and installation. This guide details how to create a new React project and add Irys support, if you already have a React project open, free to skip down a few steps.

Create a new directory for your project, cd into it, and create your React project:

```console
mkdir irys-react
cd irys-react
npx create-react-app .
```

Install the Irys SDK and ethers:

```console
npm install @irys/sdk ethers@5
```

In your `App.js` file write an initialization function that sets up a `WebIrys` object. The following code shows how to use ethers5, if you're using [a different provider](/irys-sdk/irys-in-the-browser#supported-providers) make sure to specify it when creating the `wallet`.

```js
import { providers } from "ethers";
import { WebIrys } from "@irys/sdk";

function App() {
	const initialiseIrys = async () => {
		await window.ethereum.enable();
		const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
		const wallet = { name: "ethersv5", provider: provider };
		const network = "mainnet"; // Or "devnet"
		const token = "ethereum";
		const webIrys = new WebIrys({ network, token, wallet });
		await webIrys.ready();
		return webIrys;
	};

	return <div className="App">Irys Test</div>;
}

export default App;
```

Viewing that page, you'll get a bunch of errors saying `BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default`.

To fix this you'll need to include NodeJS polyfills which are no longer included by default.

Install first react-app-rewired, a package that allows for editing of the webpack config file to fix polyfill issue. Then install the missing dependencies.

```
npm install react-app-rewired
npm install --save-dev crypto-browserify stream-browserify assert stream-http https-browserify os-browserify url buffer process
npm install browserify-zlib path-browserify path
```

At the root level of your project, create a new file called config-overrides.js and paste the following in:

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = function override(config) {
	const fallback = config.resolve.fallback || {};
	config.resolve.alias = { ...(config?.resolve?.alias ?? {}), stream: "stream-browserify" };
	Object.assign(fallback, {
		crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
		stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
		assert: require.resolve("assert"),
		http: require.resolve("stream-http"),
		https: require.resolve("https-browserify"),
		os: require.resolve("os-browserify"),
		url: require.resolve("url"),
		zlib: require.resolve("browserify-zlib"),
	});
	config.resolve.fallback = fallback;
	config.plugins = (config.plugins || []).concat([
		new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
			process: "process/browser",
			Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
		}),
	]);

	return config;
};
```

Override package.json to include the new webpack configuration. Look for this code block

```json
 "scripts": {
   "start": "react-scripts start",
   "build": "react-scripts build",
   "test": "react-scripts test",
   "eject": "react-scripts eject"
 },
```

and replace it with this block:

```json
"scripts": {
   "start": "react-app-rewired start",
   "build": "react-app-rewired build",
   "test": "react-app-rewired test",
   "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},

```

Quit React server and restart it with `npm run start` you should be good to go.
