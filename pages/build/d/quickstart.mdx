# Irys SDK

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Irys is currently in private testnet. At mainnet launch, all data uploaded to bundlers will be migrated from testnet to mainnet, with no changes to transaction IDs.
</Callout>


## Installing (using Ethereum)

Install using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/upload @irys/upload-ethereum
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	If you get a warning saying `bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)` during
	install, it can be safely ignored. For details on how make it go away, see our [troubleshooting
	guide](/build/d/troubleshooting#bigint).
</Callout>

## Importing & Connecting

The Irys SDK reduces dependency bloat by providing dedicated packages for each token. Your import statements and connection code will differ depending on the token used for payment.

The following code is for using ethereum only, we [also have examples covering all supported tokens](/build/d/sdk/setup). 

```ts
import { Uploader } from "@irys/upload";
import { Ethereum } from "@irys/upload-ethereum";

const getIrysUploader = async () => {
  const irysUploader = await Uploader(Ethereum).withWallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);
  return irysUploader;
};
```

## Funding Irys

Fund your account on the Irys network using any of our [supported tokens](/build/d/features/supported-tokens):

```js
const fundNode = async () => {
	const irysUploader = await getIrysUploader();
	try {
		const fundTx = await irysUploader.fund(irysUploader.utils.toAtomic(0.05));
		console.log(`Successfully funded ${irysUploader.utils.fromAtomic(fundTx.quantity)} ${irysUploader.token}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error when funding ", e);
	}
};
```

## Uploading

### Uploading Data

```js
const uploadData = async () => {
	const irysUploader = await getIrysUploader();
	const dataToUpload = "hirys world.";
	try {
		const receipt = await irysUploader.upload(dataToUpload);
		console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://gateway.irysUploader.xyz/${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error when uploading ", e);
	}
};
```

### Uploading a File

```js
const uploadFile = async () => {
	const irysUploader = await getIrysUploader();
	// Your file
	const fileToUpload = "./myImage.png";

	const tags = [{ name: "application-id", value: "MyNFTDrop" }];

	try {
		const receipt = await irysUploader.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags: tags });
		console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error when uploading ", e);
	}
};
```

### Uploading a Folder

You can upload a group of files as a single transaction from both the server and the browser.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	When [uploading a folder](/build/d/sdk/upload/uploadFolder), files can be accessed either directly at
	`https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactionId` or `https://gateway.irys.xyz/:manifestId/:fileName`
</Callout>


```js
const uploadFolder = async () => {
	const irysUploader = await getIrysUploader();

	// Upload an entire folder
	const folderToUpload = "./my-images/"; // Path to folder
	try {
		const receipt = await irysUploader.uploadFolder("./" + folderToUpload, {
			indexFile: "", // Optional index file (file the user will load when accessing the manifest)
			batchSize: 50, // Number of items to upload at once
			keepDeleted: false, // whether to keep now deleted items from previous uploads
		}); // Returns the manifest ID

		console.log(`Files uploaded. Manifest ID ${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error when uploading ", e);
	}
};
```

## 3rd-Party Build Tools

### Parcel

If using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), you will need to [manually enable package exports](https://parceljs.org/features/dependency-resolution/#package-exports) by adding the following to the `package.json` file in your project root directory.

```json
{
	"@parcel/resolver-default": {
		"packageExports": true
	}
}
```
