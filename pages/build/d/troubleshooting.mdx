# Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting common errors during installation and use.

Errors:

- [bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)](#bigint)
- [Error: Not enough balance for transaction](#insufficient-balance)
- [Error: Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found](#blockhash-not-found)

## bigint

**Error message:** bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)

This error can be safely ignored, it will not cause any issues. To make the error go away, you'll need to install updated Python and C++ build tools.

**MacOS**

Current versions of MacOS come pre-built with Python. To install the C++ build tools:

- First install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
- Once XCode is installed, go to Preferences, Downloads, and install the Command Line Tools

**Windows**

Windows users need to install both Python and C++ build tools. These commands must be run with administrator permissions.

```console
// First run:
npm i -g --add-python-to-path --vs2015 --production windows-build-tools

// Then run:
npm i -g node-gyp@latest
```

**UNIX**

Most UNIX distributions come with Python installed. To install C++ build tools, the following works for most Debian-based systems. For others, use your package manager to install "GCC build tools".

```console
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Insufficient Balance

**Error message**: Error: Not enough balance for transaction

This error occurs when you try to upload to a node without first funding it. 

Tokens for use on our testnet can be obtained for free from common faucets like the ones for [Solana](https://faucet.solana.com/) and [Sepolia](https://sepoliafaucet.com/).

## Blockhash Not Found

**Error message**: Error: Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found

Irys depends on transactions being confirmed, however, in some situations, it may be necessary to wait for the transaction to be finalized.

This can be fixed by configuring Irys as follows:

```js
const irys = new Irys({
	url: nodeUrl,
	token,
	provider,
	config: { tokenOpts: { commitment: "finalized" } },
});
```
