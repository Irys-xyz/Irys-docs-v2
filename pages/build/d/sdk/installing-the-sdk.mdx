# Installing The SDK

Install using npm:

```console
npm install @irys-network/bundler-client
```

or yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys-network/bundler-client
```

	If you get a warning saying `bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)` during
	install, it can be safely ignored. For details on how make it go away, see our [troubleshooting
	guide](/build/d/troubleshooting#bigint).
