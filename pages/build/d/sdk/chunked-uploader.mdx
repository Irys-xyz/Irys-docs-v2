# Chunked Uploader

The Chunked Uploader is a fault-tolerant, resumable, stream-based signer and uploader. It allows you to pause and resume uploads, and to do things like create progress bars that show upload progress.


Key Terminology:

- Batch size:  the maximum number of chunks to upload at once. Defaults to 5.
- Chunk size: the maximum size of a single chunk. Defaults to 25MB. For those with slower/unstable connections, reducing both should lead to improved reliability. For those with faster connections, increasing both will lead to higher throughput, at the cost of more memory (and CPU).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The default uploader (accessed via `irys.upload()`) does chunking automatically. You only need to use the Chunked
	Uploader to access advanced features like pausing and resuming uploads, changing batch size, and changing chunk size.
