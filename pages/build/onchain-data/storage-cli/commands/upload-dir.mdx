# `upload-dir`

Uploads an entire directory of files.

**Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />

- `-n`: The network to check. Values are `mainnet` or `devnet` (if you omit, the default is `mainnet`).
- `-t`: The [token](/overview/supported-tokens) to use when uploading.
- `-w`: Your [private key](/cli#using-private-keys).
- `--index-file`: Name of the file to use as an index for manifests.
- `--provider-url`: RPC URL to use. This is only required when using Devnet.

## Examples

### Mainnet

```console
irys upload-dir ./myImages \
  -t ethereum \
  -w bf20......c9885307
```

### Devnet

```console
irys upload-dir ./myImages \
  -n devnet \
  -t ethereum \
  -w bf20......c9885307 \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.dev
```

## Downloading

Files uploaded via `irys upload-dir` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating a URL with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/[manifest-id]/[original-file-name]`.
2. Creating a URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/[transacton-id]`

After a successful folder upload, two files are written to your local project directory:

- `[folder_name].csv`
- `[folder_name].json`

The example below highlights a folder called “llama_folder” with a total of 5 files in it. The transaction id for each file can be used to retrieve the uploaded data by forming a URL with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz]/[transaction-id]`
