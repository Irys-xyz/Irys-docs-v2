# Upload events

The uploader emits three events during each upload. These can be subscribed to for any use case when tracking upload progress is needed.

-   `chunkUpload`: Emitted whenever a chunk is uploaded.
-   `chunkError`: Emitted whenever a chunk upload fails. Due to internal retry logic, these errors can most likely be ignored as long as the upload doesn't error overall.
-   `done`: Emitted when the upload completes.

```js
uploader.on("chunkUpload", (chunkInfo) => {
	console.log(
		`Uploaded Chunk number ${chunkInfo.id}, offset of ${chunkInfo.offset}, size ${chunkInfo.size} Bytes, with a total of ${chunkInfo.totalUploaded} bytes uploaded.`,
	);
});

uploader.on("chunkError", (e) => {
	console.error(`Error uploading chunk number ${e.id} - ${e.res.statusText}`);
});

uploader.on("done", (finishRes) => {
	console.log(`Upload completed with ID ${finishRes.id}`);
});
```
