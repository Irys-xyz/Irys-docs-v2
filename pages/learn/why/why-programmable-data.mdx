## Why

In most datachains today, data is a static, passive entity. It’s collected, stored, and left to rest. Sure, these datachains are a significant improvement over storage on execution chains, but the data itself is stagnant. It doesn’t move, adapt, or do anything on its own.

But what if data could actually work for you? What if it could act, respond, and evolve through smart contracts that execute pre-defined logic?

That's what programmable data does.
    
## Putting Data to Work

On Irys, data is equipped with instructions, carrying specific properties and rules as it moves across applications. This means that data can actively execute ownership rights, enforce royalty structures, uphold encryption standards, or even carry interaction rules with other applications. Each piece of data on Irys has the potential to carry these embedded properties—and much, much more.

This isn’t just data sitting around. It’s data with a job to do, carrying its purpose within it and executing that purpose as it interacts with smart contracts and applications across an ecosystem.

## The Role of IrysVM

What makes this kind of programmable data possible on Irys? It’s the native pathway between the data layer and IrysVM, allowing instructions to be executed directly onchain at a fraction of the typical cost. Unlike traditional execution chains where fragmentation and offchain solutions drive up costs, Irys provides a fully integrated, affordable approach. Everything happens onchain, reducing the headaches of working with data on first-generation datachains, while also opening new possibilities for applications and use cases that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to build.
