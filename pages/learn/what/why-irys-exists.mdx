# Why Irys Exists

## The Complexity Problem
    
Developers face a labyrinth of fragmented storage solutions. Each system adds layers of complexity, leading to higher costs, slower processes, and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Managing these disparate systems is far more than a simple inconvenience—it’s a major barrier to scaling applications effectively.
    
## The Static Data Problem
    
Data without support for meaningful interaction is data that’s stuck. Early datachains treated storage and execution as separate worlds. This static nature of stored data limits its potential, making it difficult to build applications that make commitments about that data. It’s a system built for storage, not for innovation.
    
## The Centralization Problem
    
True decentralization means no single entity holds too much power. Yet, first-generation datachains are dominated by a few players, risking manipulation and reducing the trust and security the system promises. This centralization undermines the very principles blockchains were designed to uphold.
    
## The Unreliable Pricing Problem
    
Unpredictable, high costs are a developer’s nightmare. Building applications that rely on onchain data should be an economically feasible venture, but fluctuating storage fees make it difficult to budget and plan long-term projects. Without cost stability, innovation is stifled, and many promising ideas never leave the drawing board.
