# What a Datachain Is

A datachain is a blockchain designed for one task: storing data. Unlike blockchains optimized **only** for executing smart contracts—where storage is exceptionally expensive—datachains focus on keeping data onchain affordably. They make it possible to store large quantities of data without the excessive costs associated with typical execution-heavy blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.

The early datachains solved one clear problem: the need for economical onchain storage. But while they excelled at storing information, they stopped there. A stored piece of data remains just that—stored. It isn’t part of any system where it can react, interact, or fuel other applications. 

The next step is making stored data useful and versatile, capable of driving an ecosystem.
