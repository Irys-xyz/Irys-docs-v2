# Transactions

Irys utilizes two separate blocklanes for transactions: one for storage and one for execution. This separation allows for optimized pricing based on the specific resources users interact with.

- **Value Transfers**: The simplest transaction type on Irys, moving tokens between account addresses.

- **Data Transactions**: These transactions write directly to Irys's advanced storage layer, leveraging multiple data ledgers for permanent or fixed-term storage. Storage fees are stable, charged upfront as a one-time payment, with users [paying only for their actual usage](/learn/economics).

- **Compute Transactions**: These interact with onchain programs in Irys's execution layer, backed by IrysVM and secured by consensus. Users pay for the amount of computation used. When the execution blocklane reaches capacity, fees increase to match demand.
