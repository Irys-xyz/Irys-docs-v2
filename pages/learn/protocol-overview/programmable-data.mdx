# Programmable Data

## Range Specification

To interact with Irys’s ledger data during smart contract execution, each transaction specifies the range of data chunks it requires (A chunk range specifier). These ranges are designed to align with Ethereum’s **EIP-2930 access lists**, ensuring compatibility and efficient interoperability with existing developer tooling.

The format for specifying ranges is:

```jsx
<partition_index>:<offset>:<chunk_count>
```

- **partition_index**: (26 bytes) The index of the partition in the Publish Ledger containing the first chunk.
- **offset**: (4 bytes) The starting chunk offset within the partition.
- **chunk_count**: (2 bytes) The number of sequential chunks to retrieve starting from the offset.

This structure allows precise targeting of data stored within Irys’s partitions, enabling efficient data retrieval for execution.

In addition, Programmable Data also offers *Byte Read Ranges*, which build on top of chunk read ranges to provide easy access to specific parts of a transaction's data.

the format for a byte read range is:
```jsx
<index>:<chunk_offset>:<byte_offset>:<length>
```
-
- **partition_index**: (26 bytes) The index of the partition in the Publish Ledger containing the first chunk.
- **offset**: (4 bytes) The starting chunk offset within the partition.
- **chunk_count**: (2 bytes) The number of sequential chunks to retrieve starting from the offset.



## Pricing for Programmable Data

### Base Fee

Unpacking and deserializing data for IrysVM incurs computational overhead, which is mitigated through a **base fee** to prevent spam. 

During the testnet phase:

- The base fee for **1MB of Programmable Data** is **$0.01**.
- Programmable Data transactions have a minimum cost of **$0.01**.

This pricing ensures affordability while maintaining system integrity.

### Congestion pricing / Priority Fees

Dynamic pricing adjusts access costs to Irys’s data ledgers based on market demand and network congestion, inspired by Ethereum’s fee adjustment model.

With testnet block times of **30 seconds**, the network can process up to **7,500 chunks per block** (at 250 chunks/second). Each chunk represents **256KiB of data**.

- **Increase:**
    
    If more than **50%** of block capacity is used, the base fee scales linearly up to **+12.5%** when all **7,500 chunks** are consumed.
    
- **Decrease**:

    If no chunks are used, the base fee decreases by up to **-12.5%** per block, with a **minimum floor of $0.01** and no upper limit.

    

This congestion pricing model avoids unpredictable spikes in costs, providing developers with **consistent economic efficiency**, even during peak demand.


## Data Availability & Synchronization

Irys ensures robust data availability through an efficient synchronization mechanism that leverages both peer-to-peer sharing and miner-based retrieval. This multi-layered approach guarantees data accessibility under all conditions.

### Peer-to-Peer Broadcasting

Nodes broadcast Programmable Data (PD) transactions to their peers, marking whether they already possess the requested chunks.

Peers that lack chunks can request them directly from broadcasting nodes.

### Request and Response

Broadcasting nodes track which peers need the chunks and send them upon availability.

Receiving peers rebroadcast transactions, tracking peers that lack chunks to maintain propagation.

### Fallback to Miners

If a peer fails to receive chunks within a predefined propagation delay (**200ms for testnet**), it queries miners responsible for the relevant partitions.

The ledger identifies replicas, and the node randomly selects a partition for retrieval.

This fallback ensures reliable access, even under heavy network demand.


## Verifying Data for Execution

Transaction validation for Programmable Data involves verifying the integrity and availability of the requested chunks. Nodes can retrieve and validate chunks through several pathways:

### Cached Unpacked Chunks

Nodes leverage previously cached, verified chunks validated against their Merkle roots, ensuring readiness for IrysVM execution.

### Local Packed Chunks

If the node mines the partition containing the requested chunks but only has packed versions, it performs the following steps:

1. Generates the entropy for the specified chunk range.
2. Unpacks the chunks using the computed entropy.
3. Builds a Merkle root from the unpacked chunks.
4. Looks up the transaction that posted the chunks using the block index.
5. Compares the computed Merkle root with the one stored in the transaction.
6. If valid, shares unpacked chunks with peers lacking them.

### Received Unpacked Chunks

When receiving unpacked chunks from peers, the node validates the data by:

1. Following steps 4–5 from the "Local Packed Chunks" process.

### Requesting Chunks from Miners

If the node cannot retrieve chunks through caching or peers within the expected propagation delay (**D** = 200ms for testnet):

1. The node queries the ledger to identify partitions responsible for storing the chunks.
2. It selects a partition replica at random and requests the chunks.
3. If the chunks are provided in a packed state, the node unpacks them and validates using steps 4–6 from the "Local Packed Chunks" process.

This comprehensive validation ensures the accuracy and reliability of programmable data before execution, maintaining the **integrity of smart contract interactions**.
