# Irys Gateway

The **Irys Gateway** is the interface that provides organized, reliable access to data on the network:

## Indexing
The gateway continuously indexes all transaction metadata on Irys, ensuring that each item stored on the network is easily accessible. Bundles are indexed at a granular level to facilitate precise access and retrieval across multiple datasets.

## Querying
Users can search data with customized queries using GraphQL or REST APIs. Irys also supports advanced search options by allowing users to assign custom metadata tags for each data upload.

## Serving Data
**Data retrieval is prioritized by the gateway to maintain efficiency:**

- The gateway first checks its own local cache for recently accessed data.
- If data is not found locally, the gateway checks Irys’s broader optimistic cache for stored but less frequently accessed data.
- Finally, it accesses the miners’ network, reinforcing the availability and integrity of data across the system.
