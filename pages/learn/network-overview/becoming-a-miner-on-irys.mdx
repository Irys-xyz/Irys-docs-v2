# Becoming a Miner on Irys

Miners on Irys do more than just solve computations; they stake resources and pledge specific data partitions, integrating a Proof of Work (PoW) / Proof of Stake consensus model to create a network built on integrity and accountability.

This dual-layer commitment—both computational and economic—reinforces network reliability and deters malicious behavior.

## Mining Requirements

### System Requirements

- **CPU**: A fast core with SHA-256 extensions is recommended to handle the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF).
- **Storage**: Each partition requires 16TB, with enterprise-grade HDDs providing the necessary durability and performance.
- **GPU for Packing**: A modern gaming GPU can accelerate the Matrix Packing process by dividing tasks across multiple processors, helping prepare data for verification quickly.
- **Minimum system requirements** will be established based on performance observed during testnet.

### Consensus Model

- Irys uses a consensus model that combines Proof of Work with Proof of Staking
- Staked resources anchor each miner's commitment to the network's stability.
- Staked, verified addresses allow for secure and direct communication across the network, reducing attack vectors and ensuring data consistency.

### Data Partitioning and Verification

- Before mining, each 16TB partition undergoes Matrix Packing. This structured process prepares data for efficient verification and aligns with Irys’s high standards for accuracy and accessibility.
