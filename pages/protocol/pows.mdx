# Proof of Work + Staking

Irys introduces a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Work and Staking (PoW+S). Unlike classic PoW, miners on Irys also make economic commitments to specific mining addresses and make pledges to the portions of the [ledger](/protocol/ledgers) they store.

Miners face slashing penalties for inappropriate behavior, creating strong disincentives for adversarial actions compared to pure PoW networks.

Benefits of the hybrid model:

- Higher Commitment: Staked participants ensure greater reliability.
- Known Participants: Efficient communication between known, staked addresses.
- Scalable and Cost-Effective: Staking deters grinding attacks, enabling scalable and cost-effective data posting.
- Efficient Sampling: Miners prove data with minimal network interactions.
